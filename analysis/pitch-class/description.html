Pitchscapes: display the most common pitch at various timescapes
in musical works.  Each color in the following plot indicates a
different pitch.  A key-to-color map is given underneath each plot
for reference.  Black tick marks below each plot show the location
of barlines in the score, while the vertical axis shows the
strength/duration of the key region.  Click on the ID for a particular
work to view the music notation.  Only complete works with no missing
parts are included on this page.
