## **Sources**
Most pieces are _unica_, surviving in only one printed edition or, in a few cases, a single manuscript. When multiple printed editions exist, the _princeps_ is typically used as principal source. Reprints are nonetheless consulted and their variant readings reported in the critical notes. A reprint is used as principal source only when the _princeps_ is incomplete or damaged, or when the reprint is explicitly meant to correct the _princeps_ (e.g., "Madrigali...nuouamente ristampati & corretti"). 

Due to the size and scope of the Tasso in Music Project, for each source only a single exemplar is typically consulted, preferably one for which there exists a digitized copy, links to which are provided in the work pages. Multiple exemplars are consulted only when the one originally examined is damaged, illegible, or evidently corrupt. 

When sources are incomplete, that is, they lack one or more of the original parts, pieces are left incomplete. Given the large variety of composers represented in the Tasso in Music Project, it would be virtually impossible to provide stylistically appropriate reconstructions of missing parts for all the pieces affected (ca. 30% of the total). Although incomplete, these pieces can still be of interest for musical historians and literary scholars alike. For example, they may shed light on the circulation and transmission of the literary texts in musical environments. Moreover, the Tasso in Music Project's editions of the incomplete pieces may serve as a starting point for scholars and performers wishing to compose their own reconstructions. 

## **Editions Layout**
All editions are presented in modern score format, with regularly spaced bar lines and parts lined up from higher to lower ranges. Quinto, Sesto, and Settimo parts are always placed below corresponding Canto, Alto, and Tenore parts in the same ranges. Basso Continuo parts are always placed at the bottom of the score. Individual parts can be visualized and extracted by clicking on the icons displaying the parts' initials at the top left of the piece's work page.

## **Clefs**
Original clefs are converted by default in the editions into their modern equivalents (treble, octave treble, bass). Original clefs, however, can be restored in the editions by clicking on the "O" icon to the top right of the piece's work page.

## **Mensuration/Time Signatures**
Mensuration signs are converted by default in the editions into modern equivalents. Original mensuration signs, however, can be restored in the editions by clicking on the "O" icon to the top right of the piece's work page.

Late Italian madrigals and related genres are marked by great metric and rhythmic variety within individual pieces, such that the mensuration sign provided at the beginning does not necessarily fit the metric and rhythmic organization of the piece in its entirety. With this concept in mind, and the consequent need for flexibility especially in performance, the two most common mensuration signs in the repertoire of the Tasso in Music Project, <span class="mensuration">C</span> and <span class="mensuration">Cut-C</span>, are generally rendered with the modern time signatures 4/2 and 2/1, respectively, with barring for both at the level of the breve (double whole note). The mensuration sign <span class="mensuration">C</span> and the modern equivalent used in this edition, 4/2, suggest a pulse at the level of minim (half-note), whereas <span class="mensuration">Cut-C</span> and 2/1 suggest a pulse at the level of the semibreve (whole note). In some later pieces featuring especially short rhythmic values, <span class="mensuration">C</span> and <span class="mensuration">Cut-C</span> are generally rendered with the modern time signatures 4/4 and 2/2, respectively, with barring for both at the level of the semibreve (whole note).

Modern renditions of other mensuration signs are derived accordingly. When mensuration signs change within a piece, typically from duple to triple and vice versa, equivalence formulas are provided above the corresponding modern time signatures in the score. 

## **Rhythmic Values**
Original rhythmic values are retained in all pieces. Ligatures are spelled out and marked with continuous brackets above the notes to which they refer. Coloration is typically rendered with triplets and marked with dashed brackets above the affected notes.

## **Accidentals**
All accidentals in the principal source are reported in the edition and are placed before the note to which they refer, even if they are redundant by modern practice (e.g., an accidental applied to multiple notes of the same pitch in a single measure). When sharps and flats in the principal source are intended to cancel the opposite sign, they are rendered with modern naturals. All other accidentals are editorial and are placed above the note to which they refer. Whether original or editorial, accidentals other than those given in the key signature apply only to the note before or above which they are placed. 

## ** Basso Continuo**
Basso continue figures are reported as they appear in the source and left unrealized to allow scholars and performers to craft their own renditions. The figures are placed below the staff to avoid possible overlap with the text underlay of the texted part placed above the continuo line.

## **Text Underlay**
The text underlay in the editions follows as closely as possible that of the principal sources. For this reason, original spellings are generally retained, even when they reflect regional inflections. Likewise, following late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century practice, the first letter of each line of poetry is capitalized. Editorial intervention is limited to the following:

- Spellings are altered only when they may generate confusion or when they are inconsistent across parts, in which case they are normalized the more frequently occurring spelling.
- Accents are normalized to modern Italian standards as early modern practice is not only inconsistent but also potentially confusing to modern readers (e.g., the conjunction "e" is often spelled with a grave accent "è").
- Punctuation is editorial as in the sources it is either completely missing or highly inconsistent. Textual repetitions are always separated by commas.
- Abbreviations such as "&" are spelled out.
- The symbol _ij_, indicating textual repetition, is resolved, with repeated text given in angled brackets (<>).  

## **Critical Report**
Besides information about sources (full titles, dedicatees extant part-books, locations of exemplars consulted, original clefs, original mensuration signs), the work pages feature a detailed critical report documenting emended readings of the principal source, whether in the music or in the text underlay, and other critical notes, such as variant readings in reprints. Emended readings and other critical notes are always given in the following format: measure, part, annotation (e.g., M. 2, T, second note is a minim). Measure numbers in the critical report are highlighted and clickable, directing the reader to the portions of the score to which the critical notes refer.

## **Commentary**
Each edition is accompanied by a commentary that provides information about the composer, the overall style of the piece, and any distinctive features. Relationships between the piece and settings of the same poem by other composers or other Tasso settings by the same composer, when they exist, are also discussed. If the piece has been discussed by other scholars, bibliographic references to relevant articles, books, edition prefaces, etc. are provided in the body of the commentary, with hyperlinks if the cited items are available digitally.

## **Other Modern Editions**
When another modern edition of a piece exists, a bibliographic reference is provided at the bottom of the work page, with n hyperlink if the edition is available digitally.

## **Encoding/Visualization/Download**
The musical editions are encoded in Humdrum (www.humdrum.com), a non-commercial music notation software system created by David Huron of Ohio State University and further developed by Craig Sapp of Stanford’s Center for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities. Although Humdrum is the primary data processing and archival format for the Tasso in Music Project, the editions can be viewed and downloaded in several other formats:
- Verovio (http://www.verovio.org/index.xhtml), a scalable vector graphics (SVG) system through which users can visualize the score entirely online
- PDF
- MEI: Music Encoding Initiative XML format for music
- MusicXML: another XML representation of music, used to transfer data entry of the musical texts from the music editor software (Finale) into the Humdrum format
- MuseData: predecessor of MusicXML, used for generating music notation
- MIDI: audio-file used to listen to computer-generated performances
- MP3: converts symbolic MIDI data into audio files for a more stable website listening experience
