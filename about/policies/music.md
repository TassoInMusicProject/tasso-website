## **Sources**
Most pieces are _unica_, surviving in only one printed edition or, in a few cases, a single manuscript. When mulitple printed editions exist, the _princeps_ is typically used as principal source. Reprints are nonetheless consulted and their variant readings reported in the critical notes. A reprint is used as principal sources only when the _princeps_ is incomplete or damaged, or when the reprint is expcilitely meant to correct the _princeps_ (e.g., "Madrigali...nuouamente ristampati & corretti"). Due to the size and scope of the Tasso in Music Project, for each source only a single examplar is typically consulted, preferably one for which there exists a digitized copy, links to which are provided in the work pages. Multiple exemplars are consulted only when the one originally consulted is damaged, illegible, or evidently corrupt. 

## **Editions Layout**
All edition are presented in modern score format, with regularly spaced bar lines and parts lined up from higher to lower ranges. Quinto, Sesto, and Settimo parts are always placed below corresponding Canto, Alto, and Tenore parts in the same ranges. Basso Continuo parts are always placed at the bottom of the score. Individual parts can be visualized and extracted by clicking on the icons displaying the parts' initials at the top left of the piece's work page.

## **Clefs**
Original clefs are converted by default into their modern equivalents (treble, octave treble, bass). Original clefs, however, can be restored in the scores by clicking on the "O" icon to the top right of the piece's work page.

## **Mensuration/Time Signatures**

## **Rhythmic Values**
Original rhythmic values are retained in all pieces. Ligatures are spelled out and marked with continous brackets above the notes to which they refer. Coloration is typically rendered with triplets and marked with dashed brackets above the affected notes.
