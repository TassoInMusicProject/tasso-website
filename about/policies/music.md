## **Sources**
Most pieces are _unica_, surviving in only one printed edition or, in a few cases, a single manuscript. When mulitple printed editions exist, the _princeps_ is typically used as principal source. Reprints are nonetheless consulted and their variant readings reported in the critical notes. A reprint is used as principal source only when the _princeps_ is incomplete or damaged, or when the reprint is expcilitely meant to correct the _princeps_ (e.g., "Madrigali...nuouamente ristampati & corretti"). 

Due to the size and scope of the Tasso in Music Project, for each source only a single examplar is typically consulted, preferably one for which there exists a digitized copy, links to which are provided in the work pages. Multiple exemplars are consulted only when the one originally examined is damaged, illegible, or evidently corrupt. 

When sources are incomplete, that is, they lack one or more of the original parts, pieces are left incomplete. Given the large variety of composers represented in the Tasso in Music Project, it would be virtually impossible to provide stylistically appropriate reconstructions of missing parts for all the pieces affected (ca. 30% of the total). Although incomplete, these pieces can still be of interest for musical historians and literary scholars alike. For example, they may shed light on the circulation and transmission of the literary texts in musical environments. Moreover, the Tasso in Music Project's editions of the incomplete pieces may serve as a starting point for scholars and performers wishing to compose their own reconstructions. 

## **Editions Layout**
All edition are presented in modern score format, with regularly spaced bar lines and parts lined up from higher to lower ranges. Quinto, Sesto, and Settimo parts are always placed below corresponding Canto, Alto, and Tenore parts in the same ranges. Basso Continuo parts are always placed at the bottom of the score. Individual parts can be visualized and extracted by clicking on the icons displaying the parts' initials at the top left of the piece's work page.

## **Clefs**
Original clefs are converted by default in the editions into their modern equivalents (treble, octave treble, bass). Original clefs, however, can be restored in the editions by clicking on the "O" icon to the top right of the piece's work page.

## **Mensuration/Time Signatures**
Mensuration signs are converted by default in the editions into modern equivalents. Original mensuration signs, however, can be restored in the editions by clicking on the "O" icon to the top right of the piece's work page.

Late Italian madrigals and related genres are marked by great metric and rhythmic variety within individual pieces, such that the mensuration sign provided at the beginning does not necessarily fit the metric and rhythmic organization of the piece in its entirety. With this concept in mind, and the consequent need for flexibility esepcially in performance, the two most common mensuration signs in the repertoire of the Tasso in Music Project, <span class="mensuration">C</span> and <span class="mensuration">Cut-C</span>, are generally rendered with the modern time signatures 4/2 and 2/1, respectively, with barring for both at the level of the breve (double whole note). The mensuration sign <span class="mensuration">C</span> and the modern equivalent used in this editon, 4/2, suggest a pulse at the level of minim (half-note), whereas <span class="mensuration">Cut-C</span> and 2/1 suggest a pulse at the level of the semibreve (whole note). In some later pieces featuring especially short rhythmic values, <span class="mensuration">C</span> and <span class="mensuration">Cut-C</span> are generally rendered with the modern time signatures 4/4 and 2/2, respectively, with barring for both at the level of the semibreve (whole note).

Modern renditions of other mensuration signs are derived accordingly. When mensuration signs change within a piece, typically from duple to triple and viceversa, equivalence formulas are provided above the corresponding modern time signatures in the score. 

## **Rhythmic Values**
Original rhythmic values are retained in all pieces. Ligatures are spelled out and marked with continous brackets above the notes to which they refer. Coloration is typically rendered with triplets and marked with dashed brackets above the affected notes.

## **Accidentals**
Accidentals, whether original or edtiorial, apply only to the note before or above which they are placed, with the exception of those given in the key signature. All accidentals in the principal source, including those redundant by modern practice, are reported in the edition and are placed before the note to which they refer. Sharps and flats in the principal source that are intended to cancel the opposite sign are rendered with modern naturals. Other accidentals are editorial and are placed above the note to which they refer. 

## ** Basso Continuo**
Basso continue figures are reported as they appear in the source and left unrealized to allow scholars and performers to craft their own renditions. The figures are placed below the staff to avoid possible overlap with the text underlay of the texted part placed above the continuo line.

## **Critical Apparatus**

## **Commentary**
Each edition is accompanied by a commentary that provides information about the composer, the overall style of the piece, and any distinctive features. Relationships between the piece and settings of the same poem by other composers or other Tasso settings by the same composer, when they exist, are also discussed. If the piece has been discussed by other scholars, bibliographic references to relevant articles, books, edition prefaces, etc. are provided in the body of the commentary, with hyperlinks if the cited items are available digitally.

## **Other Modern Editions**
When another modern edition of a piece exists, a bibliographic reference is provided at the bottom of the work page, with an hiperlink if the edition is available digitally.
