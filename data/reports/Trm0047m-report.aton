@COMMENTARY:
	This three-voice piece by Roman composer Giovannelli appeared
	in the second book of the anthology <i>Fiori musicali</i>,
	assembled by Giacomo Vincenzi and dedicated to Francesco
	Sugana of Treviso.

	Like the first book of the anthology, it primarily features
	works by Roman and Venetian composers, many based on texts
	by Tasso.

	Giovannelli’s three-voice setting of “Non è questa la mano”
	is striking not only for its liveliness --- note the
	hectic repetition of rhythmic-melodic motives in {{mm 30 33}}
	--- but also for its ingenuous word painting.

	In particular, Giovannelli gives a musical representation
	of the poem’s subject, the female hand, by referencing the
	Guidonian hand at the beginning and at the end of the setting
	--- note the <i>hexachordum durum</i> G-E in {{mm 1 2}}
	and {{mmx 5 6}} in C and B, respectively, and the <i>hexachordum
	naturale</i> C-A in {{mm 2 4}} (ascending) and {{mm 30 31}}
	(descending) in the T and B, respectively.

	Giovannelli may have borrowed this idea from Marenzio, whose
	1581 setting of the same poem also features hexachords (see
	{{work "Trm0047b"}}).

@VERSE:
	Non &egrave; questa la mano
	Che tante e s&igrave; mortali
	Avvent&ograve; nel mio cor fiammelle e strali?
	Ecco che pur si trova
	Fra le mie man ristretta
	N&eacute; forza od arte per fuggir le giova,
	N&eacute; tien face o saetta
	Che da me la difenda.
	Giusto &egrave; ben ch'io ne prenda,
	Amor, qualche vendetta,
	E se piaghe mi di&egrave; baci le renda.

@TVERSE:
	Is this not the hand                                               
	That so many and indeed fatal
	Flames and arrows hurled at my heart?
	Yet here it is, to be found
	Held fast between my hands.
	Neither strength or craft can help it escape,
	Nor does it hold a torch or a spear
	To defend her against me.
	It is just that I take,
	Love, some kind of revenge,
	And if she gave me wounds, I give her kisses.
