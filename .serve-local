# Description: This version of the local website server will use purely local
# resources with no external webiste dependencies.  Use this version of the
# website if you are not connected to the internet.  Files in styles/local and 
# scripts/local are used rather than css/javascript files from other web addresses.
#
# Preliminaries:
# 
# To use the purely local version of the web server, first run the makefile in
# scripts/local:
#    cd scripts/local && make
# This will download the verovio-toolkit.js script needed for rendering 
# notation examples for the website.  This only has to be done the first time,
# but it would be wise to do it every once in a while, since this will keep
# the verovio toolkit version up-to-date on the local installation.
# 
# Also, you need to install jekyll to run the VHV documentation website locally.
# See the webpage: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation for instructions
# to install it.
#
# To run from the comand line, type:
#     ./.serve-local
#
# Then look for the address of the webserver, which should be:
#     http://127.0.0.1:2000
#

bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --config _config.yml,_config-local.yml
