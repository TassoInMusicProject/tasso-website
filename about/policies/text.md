## **Literary Transcriptions/Variants**
For each poem (or excerpt of larger poem), under the tab "Literary Variants" users may find diplomatic transcriptions of the poetic text as it appears in literary sources, both manuscript and printed, and in literary sources. Variant readings across sources are hihglighted and displayed dynamically in the right column of the "Literary Variants" page of each poem. The goal of the transcriptions and of the dynamic collation of variants is to facilitate the study of the textual tradition of Tasso's poems and of their transmission to composers.

## **Sources**
Given the size of the project's reperotire, poetic texts are transcribed from a single examplar of each literary and musical source, preferably one that is available digitally. Additional copies of each source are consulted only when the examplar originally consulted is incomplete or damaged. Because of the frequent discrepancies in the text underlay of the different voices of musical settings, each part-book is considered as a separate source and its text underlay is transcribed and displayed as such. 

## **Paratextual Information**
Diplomatic transcriptions of paratextual information, such as argomento, dedicatee, and genre, are displayed above poetic texts.

## **Orthography**
Original spellings are retained throughout, even when they are inconsistent or reflect regional inflections. The only emendations are the modernization of the characters “u” and “v” and the spelling out of abbreviations other than “&”.


## **Punctuation**
Original punctuation is retained throughout, even when it is inconsistent or may cause confusion to modern readers.


## **Indention/Layout**
Original indentions are retained throughout to reflect as closely as possible the layout of the poem in its literary sources. Texts drawn from musical sources are always left-justified, with editorial indentions employed to represent the partition of the text in two or more parts (<i>Prima parte</i>, <i>Seconda parte</i>, etc.) in the musical settings. 


## **Erasures/Corrections**
All erasures and corrections are reported in the transcriptions.


## **Variants**
To facilitate visualization, especially for poems that have survived in many literary and musical sources, only substantial discrepancies are considered variants and displayed as such by means of clickable highlights. Such discrepancies include: omitted or additional lines, re-ordered lines, different words in corresponding sections of the text, different word order. Discrepancies in orthography, punctuation, and indention are not considered variants and therefore are not highlighted in the transcriptions. This choice is dictated only by logistical limitations and not by disinterest in such discrepancies, which often offer valuable insight into publication and scribal practices.


## **Encoding/Visualization**
The transcriptions are encoded following standards of the Text Encoding Initiatives (TEI) and rendered in HTML to allow for a dynamic collation of literary variants across sources. The TEI schema for the transcriptions has been realized by Raffaele Viglianti (University of Maryland), who has also developed a CoreBuilder automated system for the HTML rendering of variants across sources.
