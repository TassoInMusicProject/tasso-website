## **Website Layout**
Because the project is poetry-based, the website is structured around four main sections, each devoted to a particular poem or group of poems by Tasso. The four sections, headers for which are shown on the homepage, are the following:

- <i>Rime
- Gerusalemme liberata
- Aminta
- Other Poems </i> (i.e., <i>Ecloghe</i>, <i>Rinaldo</i>, <i>Lagrime della Beata Vergine</i>, <i>Re Torrismondo</i>, <i>Gerusalemme conquistata</i>).
  
The ordering of these sections (arranged from left to right on the homepage), reflect the musical fortune of each poem or group of poems, the Rime having received over 500 settings and Other Poems having received collectively only around a dozen. 
Clicking on the main section headers displays a list of all the poems (or excerpts of a larger poem) for that section. Underneath each poem (or excerpt) there are four tabs: 

- ABOUT: links to a page featuring the text of the poem in modern edition and line-by-line English translation. For the <i>Rime</i>, the modern editions are drawn from Angelo Solerti, <i>Le rime di Torquato Tasso</i>, 4 vols. (Bologna: Romagnoli-Dall-Acqua, 1898-1902), which although dated and far from current editorial standards, remains the only comphrensive edition of Tasso's Rime. When a poem from the <i>Rime</i> is available in the currently undergoing Edizione Nazionale delle Opere di Torquato Tasso (Alessandria: Edizioni Dall'Orso), bibliographic references to this edtion are provided. The "About" pages also feature information about attribution, date of composition, dedicatees of each poem.
- LITERARY SOURCES: links to a list of 16th- and 17th-century literary sources for the poem (or excerpt), both manuscript and printed, with brief descriptions of each source and hyperlinks to digitized examplars, when they exist. 
- MUSICAL SOURCES: links to a list of musical settings for the poem. The list in turn links to workpages where each setting is available in modern edition with critical apparatus, commentary, and analytical tools.
- LITERARY VARIANTS: links to a page featuring diplomatic transcriptions of the poem (or excerpt) as it appears in literary sources, both mnasucript and literary, and in the text underlay of its musical settings. The transcriptions are collated and variant readings across sources are displayed dynamically.

## **Repertorie Organization/Cataloguing**

### **Poetic Repertoire**
- <i>Rime</i>: these poems are catalogued after Angelo Solerti's numbering in his 1898-1902 edition. Although based on an often flawed and romanticized reconstruction of the chronology of Tasso’s <i>Rime</i>, Solerti’s numbering remains universally used in Tasso scholarship. Likewise, for the literary sources of the <i>Rime</i> the project employs Solerti's sigla, with integrations for manuscript sources from Vercingetorige Martignone, <i>Catalogo dei manoscritti delle Rime di Torquato Tasso </i> (Bergamo: Centro di Studi Tassiani, 2004).

- <i>Gerusalemme liberata</i>: excerpts from this poem are arranged by Canto and Ottava. For manuscript sources, the project employs Solerti's sigla. Printed sources are catalogued by year of publication followed by publisher initials: e.g., 1581CV=Torquato Tasso, <i>Gerusalemme liberata</i> (Casalmaggiore: Canacci & Viotti, 1581).
