<summary> Description </summary>

The following table lists homophonic texture percentages found in
each work.  Identification of homophony is done with an algorithm,
so measurements are approximate.  The algorithm to identify
homophonic regions in the music works as follows:

<ul>

<li> First identify sonorities containing three or more simultaneous note
attacks.  These sonorities are assigned a score of 1.  
</li>

<li> Then assign
a score of 1/2 to any sonority sandwiched between two sonorities
with a score of 1.
</li>

<li> Then search for contiguous regions of music
with non-zero scores that exceed a total score threshold, which for
this analysis was set to 4 (at least three successive attack
sonorities with up to one low-attack sonority between them). 
</li>

</ul>

To view the homophonic textures in the musical notation, click on
the percentage for a work.  Textures are highlighted in red and
green: red indicates a high-attack region, and green indicates a
low-attack region between two high-attack regions.
Raw data for further analysis can be found on the spreadsheet:
